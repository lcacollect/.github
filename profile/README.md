# What is LCAcollect?

LCAcollect - A common solution for the AEC industry for documenting buildings' environmental impact through LCA.
The building industry have to optimize their CO₂ footprint the next coming years.

New requirements have been added to the Danish building law by the 1st of January 2023.
These new requirements will gradually be tightened - it is therefore critical that the building industry gathers experiences over the coming years -
so we can create an even better and realistic base for a greener building industry in the future.

LCAcollect.dk ensures LCA documentation in a structured and standardized format, which gives the industry the possibilities to share experiences and results in a comprehensive way.

We are sharing our learnings and experiences with the industry, state and research institutions.

# Open Source
LCAcollect is a open source initiative.

It means that everyone can download the source code and contribute with features, bug fixes and larger development activities.

It is essential that the building industry can initiate a collective action for the green transition - that is why LCAcollect invites everyone to participate in our community on GitHub.

We encourage everyone to participate and in order to ensure fairness we have adopted the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct.
